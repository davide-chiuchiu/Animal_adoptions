Animal_adoptions
This repository contains the code to produce a simpletensorflow classification model with hyperparameter auto-tuning. The code in here contains a bare-bone minimum on all the fundamental steps needed to build a tensorflow model which predicts which animals will be adopted based on various features. As such, it's a reasonable starting point for more complex projects.
